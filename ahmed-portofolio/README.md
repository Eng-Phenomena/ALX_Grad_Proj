🔧 Technologies Used
This project leverages the following technologies to create a seamless and fast experience:

React.js: For building the UI components and managing the website's interactive elements.
Vite: For blazing fast bundling and development server to provide an efficient development environment.
Tailwind CSS: For styling the website with a utility-first approach, ensuring responsive and flexible design.
HTML/CSS: For structuring and styling content as needed.
npm: For managing dependencies and scripts to streamline the development process.
